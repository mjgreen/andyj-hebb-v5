From: Andy Johnson:
Could I request a couple of minor amendments please?
  1. After the three practice trials, could there be a message stating “This is the end of the practice phase. There now follows 30 experimental trials for which you will not receive feedback. Press space bar to begin.”
  2. At the start of each trial, could there be a fixation + presented for 500ms."
